  # Fix duplicate policy error

  This migration safely handles existing policies by dropping and recreating them
  to ensure they have the correct configuration.

  ## Changes
  1. Drop existing policies if they exist
  2. Recreate policies with proper configuration
  3. Ensure all policies are correctly set up for the tasks table
